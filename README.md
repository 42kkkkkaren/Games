<p align="center">Errors while doing the game:</p>
<p>While I was making the game, I encountered an error when I first used the images and found the solution below:</p>

```AAPT: error: '@tools:sample/avatars' is incompatible with attribute src (attr) reference|color```
<p>I had to erase the line below:</p>

```android:src="@tools:sample/avatars"```
<p>It seems that when selecting new images to ImageView, it only adds another tag, so it doesn't remove the old one. </p>
